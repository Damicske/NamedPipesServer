# NamedPipesServer

This code was taken from the Microsoft website https://learn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/dotnet/standard/io/how-to-use-named-pipes-for-network-interprocess-communication, but it didn't do what I expected it todo and has some weird quircks.

I changed it till it did what I expected it todo, like starting and stopping named pipe server when a client disconnect. Stay conencted till the client disconnects.

The code is given AS IS and you can do with it what you want ;)
